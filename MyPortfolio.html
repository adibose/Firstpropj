      Hi, I am Shiladitya Bose. I am CS Grad from JIS College of Engineering,Kolkata.I am working in Capgemini for the past 2 years as a Quality Analyst.I want to make a career in Mean Stack Development and enrolling in Edwisor, is the first step towards my dream. Right now I am settled in Bangalore. The decision behind coming to Bangalore, is because of the startup culture which is quite vibrant and active in Bangalore. In future I would love to be a part of an emerging startup. I am a sports fanatic and I am pretty good at cricket, badminton and table tennis. I regularly play these sports and also actively participate in Corporate leagues. I have also won many trophies in those leagues.
